Load Testing: Used ab -n 1000 -c 50 to simulate a traffic spike.
Observed Result: AWS CloudWatch triggered a scaling event, and the ASG successfully launched additional instances to handle the load.
Failover Test: Manually terminated one instance; the ALB redirected traffic to the remaining healthy instance, and the ASG immediately provisioned a replacement.
