📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a highly available, fault-tolerant web application using Amazon Web Services (AWS).
The architecture utilizes an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group (ASG).
The primary goal was to ensure the application could handle traffic spikes automatically while maintaining 100% uptime through multi-AZ (Availability Zone) redundancy
