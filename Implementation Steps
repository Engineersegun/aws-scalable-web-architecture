1. Launch Template Configuration
Defined the "blueprint" for our servers, including:
AMI Selection: Amazon Linux 2.
User Data Scripting: Automated the update and installation of the Apache web server.
Security Groups: Configured to allow inbound traffic on Port 80 (HTTP) and Port 22 (SSH).
2. Auto Scaling Group (ASG) Setup
Configured the ASG to maintain a fleet of instances across multiple subnets.
Scaling Policy: Set a Target Tracking policy to scale out when CPU utilization exceeds 60%.
Self-Healing: If an instance becomes unhealthy, the ASG automatically terminates and replaces it.
3. Application Load Balancer (ALB)
Deployed a public-facing ALB to:
Route traffic to the Target Group managed by the ASG.
Perform health checks to ensure traffic only hits functioning servers.
